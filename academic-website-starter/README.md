# Academic Website Starter (GitHub Pages)

This folder contains a minimal, mobile-friendly academic website you can deploy on GitHub Pages in minutes.

## How to use

1. Create a new public repo named **YOURUSERNAME.github.io** on GitHub (replace with your GitHub username).
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repository root.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** / folder: **/** (root)
4. Wait 1–2 minutes, then open `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io`.

## Customize

- Replace `assets/profile-placeholder.jpg` with your headshot (same file name).
- Replace `assets/cv-placeholder.pdf` with your actual CV file (same file name).
- Edit text in `index.html` to update About, Research, Publications, Projects, Teaching, and Contact.
- Colors and layout are in `style.css`.

Optional:
- Add analytics (e.g., GA4) by pasting the script into `<head>` of `index.html`.
- Custom domain: Add your domain under **Settings → Pages** (adds a `CNAME` file).

## Tips
- Keep your CV and Publications up to date.
- For more pages, copy sections from `index.html` or make new `*.html` files and link them in the nav.
